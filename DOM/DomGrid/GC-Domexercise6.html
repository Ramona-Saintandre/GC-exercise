    Dom Exercise
Create a grid of divs (e.g., 3x3, 8x8 or 10x10). (You can use HTML or javascript to
create all these divs.) Create several buttons with color names. When one of the color
buttons is clicked, it should set the color to use (store this color in a variable). Then
when any cell is clicked, it applies that selected color. The user can keep clicking more
cells, and each one changes to the last selected color.
Extended Challenges: 1) Instead of having to click each cell, the user can click and drag
to mouse to draw. (Use mousemove event.) 2) Add a button to clear the grid.
