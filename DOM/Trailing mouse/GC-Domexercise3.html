<!-- DOM EXERCISE 3
Skills: DOM, event handler, event object
Create a circle that follows the mouse around the page. Whenever the mouse moves, the circle
immediately jumps to the new location.
Hint: The event parameter to the event handler provides information on the location of the
mouse.
Extended Challenges:
● Create a trail behind the mouse as it moves.
● Instead of the circle immediately jumping to the new mouse location, have it slowly
make progress toward the cursor. -->
