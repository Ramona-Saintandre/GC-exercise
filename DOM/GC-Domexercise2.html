<!-- DOM EXERCISE 2
Skills: DOM, event handlers, arrays
Using plain old HTML & CSS, set up a form and two ordered lists like this, however, start with
empty lists...
Now, write JavaScript so that each time the form is submitted, a new item with the given name
is added to the list selected by the type radio buttons.
Hint: First get it working with just always adding to one of the lists, then figure out the radio
button selection. -->
